# Type: Python module.
#
# Comments: Module defining Public Goods Game functions.
#
# Usage:
# Import this file from other Python files.
#
# To do:
#   - clarify issues on Ubuntu/Eclipse with
#       - import scipy as sp
#         from scipy import optimize
#         sp.optimize.leastsq()
#   - integrate use of Clausen_2009b algorithm for power law check and parameter fit
#   - implement steady state check in is_steady_state
#   - define read_pgg_graph
#     note that read_pgg_graph currently reads the PGG graph from a file but
#     initializes subsequently, clearly not what we want;
#     to simplify things, it might make sense to abandon the idea behind
#     read_pgg_graph; in the current form it is not functional;
#     note also that the previous and the new tss files would overlap on
#     the last and first record respectively
#   - why k = 4 and p = 0.4 for watts-strogatz
#   - why p = 0.4 for erdos-renyi
#   - make sure that nx.read_gml and nx.write_gml handle arbitrary graph
#     attributes
