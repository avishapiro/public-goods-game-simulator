Main code and parameters for running the PGG simulation is in `PGG_Simulator.py`. Use the `-h` flag for further instructions on how to use this script.
The game is defined by functions in `pgg.py`.

For preliminary analysis based on this code see this [poster](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~ashapiro/Avi_Shapiro/Research_files/Poster_2014_PGG_SIAM-WNS.pdf).
